Motion Sensor 
An android app to check the movement of a smartphone i.e. to calculate the velocity in x,y,z direction and angular velocity in x,y,z axes.
Here is the screenshot of app :

I use two motion sensors.
First is Rotation Vector to calculate the velocity in x,y,z direction.
Second is Gyroscope sesnor which is used to calculate the angular velocity in x,y,z axes.
The velocities will print on the app screen and changes accordingly when we rotate our phone.
